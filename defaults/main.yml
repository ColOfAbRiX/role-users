# Local groups. See documentation for the "group" module
system_groups: []
#   # Example of definition of a group
# - name:  administrators
#   gid:   1234
#   state: present

# Local users. See documentation for the "user" module Each item has the
# attribute "type" that specify if the user is local or remote. The role will
# also create a group with the same name as the user's group and as default
# behaviour it will assign this group as the user's primary group.
system_users: []
# # Example of user created on the machine. The options that are allowed are the
# # same as the Ansible module "user". The password of this user is given
# - username:       alice
#   groups:         secondary_group1
#   type:           local
#   password:       Passw0rd
# # This user creation is as above but this time the role will generate a random
# # password. The password is not saved anywhere and the feature is used to lock
# # the account. An explicit password field has priority over use_random_pwd.
# - username:       bob
#   type:           local
#   password:       Passw0rd
#   use_random_pwd: true
# # The type: "remote" instructs the system that the user definition is not on
# # the local system but somewhere remote and the only thing that will be set up
# # is the user's home directory.
# - username:       carl
#   type:           remote
# # This makes sure the user is not present on the system
# - username:       david
#   state:          absent
# # This is how you can trust an SSH key:
# - username:       david
#   state:          present
#   authorize_ssh_key: "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA..."
